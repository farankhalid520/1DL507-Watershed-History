Max provdjup (m),Max sample depth (m),
TOC (mg/l C),"this is the total organic carbon measured on an unfiltered sample. This record is more complete and since most of the carbon in the water is likely dissolved organic carbon, you can use this is as the dependant variable",
DOC (mg/l C),"measured for water filtered to 0.45 um, a much sparser record so you can check it against the TOC data to see how the TOC represents the DOC",
Tot-N_ps (µg/l N),total nitrogen,"this includes nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, and all nitrogen in organic molecules"
Tot-N_TNb (µg/l N),total nitrogen measured in a different way,"this includes nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, and all nitrogen in organic molecules"
Abs_F 254 (/5cm),"absorbance at 254 nm, you can use this to calculate a metric of organic carbon quality, see Domain information column","You can calculate the specific UV absorbance at 254 nm using this formula and the TOC value (as a proximate DOC value): 
(1) First set units of absorbance to per meter: (abs/5)*100
(2) Then Correct absorbance for Fe absorbance: abs (in m) - (0.0653 * Fe concentration in mg/L) + 0.002 (see Poulin ref below)
(3) then divide this corrected absorbance value by the TOC concentration below (in units of mg/L) so you have final units of SUVA254 in m*L/mg. This is a measure of how aromatic the organic carbon is and can be used as another dependant variable.

SO4 (mekv/l),Sulfate,"Could be an interesting variable to look at in relation to organic carbon and different watersheds. Because of the history of acid rain in Sweden, sulfate has inhibited DOC release from the watersheds, but this is more pronounced in forested watersheds, since in wetlands the sulfate was washed away"
Cl (mekv/l),chloride,
F (mekv/l),fluoride,
NH4-N (µg/l N),ammonium ,"these are important nutrients that could organic carbon indirectly, either through primary production and release of organic carbon from primary production, or through providing nutrients for microorganisms to break down organic carbon"

Si (mg/l),silicon,"in certain forms, can be an important nutrients for primary producers"
